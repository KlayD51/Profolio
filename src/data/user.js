            "I am a developer with experience in front-end and an interest in backend, with expertise in Node.js and Javascript libraries like React and Next.js.  Through my experiences at internships like the NBA Digital Product team I have been able to get experience with testing, cloud development, and building quality/efficient code.  During my time with comcast I was introduced to the world op Open-Source and was introduced to skills like Next.JS and RoR, less used today but an amazing thing to pick up and a great way to expand my knowledge.  More recently, I have been moving towards full-stack with more work with sql and data manipulation in general.  I am eager to continue to develop my skills through problem solving and opportunities to grow. ",
